# Meh.

Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Tell her she looks thin. Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle.

File not found. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. It's okay, Bender. __I like cooking too.__ *Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk!* I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.

## Oh, I think we should just stay friends.

Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! I'm Santa Claus! You guys aren't Santa! You're not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus?

1. I'll get my kit!
2. Oh right. I forgot about the battle.
3. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!

### I don't want to be rescued.

No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?

* Is that a cooking show?
* Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?
* Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.

Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying!

Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.

Pansy. Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!

And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. No, just a regular mistake. Kids have names?

Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.

If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. I wish! It's a nickel. Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff!

We're rescuing ya. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Then we'll go with that data file! Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!

That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. I can explain. It's very valuable. How much did you make me? That's the ONLY thing about being a slave.

For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.

I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny! Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. You lived before you met me?! Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?

That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.
